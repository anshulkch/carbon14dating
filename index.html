								<h2>What is Carbon-14 Dating?</h2>
								<p>Carbon-14 Dating (also known as Carbon Dating) is a method used to calculate the age of<br> previously living things. It relies on the decay of atmospheric nitrogen to a radiocarbon <br>(carbon-14), which then becomes absorbed by living things when they ingest air or food,<br> which both contain carbon dioxide. The measurement of the amount of radiocarbons <br>left following decay allows us to determine how long ago the plant or animal was alive.</p>

								<h2>The Carbon Cycle</h2>
								<p>The cyclation of carbon throughout the environment, which includes the decaying of atmospheric nitrogen to form the carbon-14 atoms required for carbon dating. As long as they are alive, plants and animals absorb this carbon. Future generations, however, will not be able to measure carbon levels as accurately due to the high levels of CO<sub>2</sub> released by factories that offset the nitrogen to carbon ratio in the air.</p>

								<h2>Carbon-14 Decay</h2>
                                <p>The decay of Carbon-14 is due to emission of electrons, which in turn causes a nuetron to decay to a proton, yielding a Nitrogen-14 isotope. This nitrogen atom returns to the environment and restarts the carbon cycle. By measuring the percentage of Carbon-14 left, scientist are able to calculate when the plant or animal died. However, the maximum amount of years calculable through this process is 50,000, due to the half-life of Carbon-14 which decays completely at that time.</p>

								<h2>Real-World Application</h2>
								<p>Carbon Dating is mainly used geology, archeology, and anthropology. The placement of various artifacts and fossils allow us to reconstruct the timeline of the Earth. Scientists can also estimate the life of a glacier and how much longer it will live by carbon dating the peat moss underneath.</p>
